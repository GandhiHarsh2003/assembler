# LC-q Assembler
Develop a simple assembler for a simplified version of the Assembly Language LC-3, which itself is a simplified version of a modern assembly language. Assembly language, is essentially the language of the computer, is often used in control systems. The commands available in an assembly language are very limited but are sufficient to accomplish virtually any task that can be done with higher-order languages, since those are actually translated to the machine language anyway. The task was to interpret a simplified assembly code.
